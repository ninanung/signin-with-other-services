# signin-with-other-services

## What is this?

I just want to try some Google, Facebook and Github OAuth login for practicing.

## Before start

Ok, i'm trying to make OAuth login with other services, so i made three buttons for each login. Google, Facebook and Github, not a big deal, even easy job. I forgot some of Vue features, so googled few times and boom. Ready for connection.

## Github

I like to login with Github. It makes me feel more developer.
